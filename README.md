# bachelor_thesis
This is the folder structure for my bachelor thesis on. It is about balanced networks and replacating and building on the results by van Vreeswijk and Sompolinsky (1998).

Especially, I take a look at how long external input can be stored in a chaotic environment.

I provide a graphic interface to parts of my program via the graphical.py function.
All scripts can also be run via the initiate.py file and evaluated via the plots.py file.
The model itself resides in the neuron.py file.
